## CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block, which is simply a range of IP addresses.
- An IPv4 (version 4 of IP) address is usually represented as four 8-bit decimal numbers or octets separated by dots.
- An 8-bit number when represented in the decimal system as opposed to binary has a range of 0–255.
- So all four octets together add up to 32 bits, for a range of 0.0.0.0–255.255.255.255.
- In CIDR notation, this full range would be represented as 0.0.0.0/0. The final digit after the “/” represents how many bits make up the mask.
