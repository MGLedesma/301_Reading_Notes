Microsoft's Patch Tuesday

- aka "Update Tuesday" is when Microsoft releases update packages for their operating system and other software applications
- as the name implies, it occurs on the second Tuesday of each month in North America
- critical security flaws update are issued as "out-of-band" that could arrive anytime. The Tuesday package contains updates that didn't have to be rushed out.
- in Microsoft's update parlance, Patch Tuesday is called "B" updates. "C" and "D" are optional updates that include bug fixes and improvements for problems that aren't security holes. After the C and D are tested and fixed, the update make it into the next month's B update.
- big update is not part of Patch Tuesday because it don't contain new features, it contain important security updates and already tested bug fixes.
- other companies have chosen to join Patch Tuesday like the Adobe Flash Player browser plug-in
- by default, is an automatic install update for all windows user.

Microsoft does this to make the update process as predictable as possible for administrators so they can make plans to test or install them.
